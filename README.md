## What is this for? 🍻

It's always a hazzle setting everything up for an Electron project - and stuff usually become a little bit messy. This bad boi is going to (mainly for me) make getting going with React and Electron a lot easier, and cleaner. Hopefully.

## Where can I get it? 🤲

Clone the repo and get going!

## Instructions 💅

1. Clone the repo 💾
2. Install packages `pnpm`
3. For `dev` use `pnpm dev` from the root
4. For `production` use `pnpm build` from the root
   1. The `build` will be located in the root directory in the folder `builds`
